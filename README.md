Yo, I’m Farid.
Yo, coding is like that toxic relationship you can’t quit. One day I’m lovin’ it, the next day I’m ready to smash my laptop. But no matter what, I’m back at it the next day. It’s like an addiction, you know? Python, Django, FastAPI – it’s like I’m hooked. Some days it feels like I’m on top of the world, but then there are days when I’m like, “Why the hell am I doin’ this to myself?”

But here’s the thing – I’m grindin’ every day, tryna get better. I ain’t stoppin’. It’s a love-hate kinda thing, but the hustle doesn’t end. I wanna level up, push myself harder, and keep learning. It’s all about that daily grind, constantly getting sharper, even when it feels like I’m stuck.

If you feel that same pull, that drive to get better even when it’s tough, we’re on the same vibe.
